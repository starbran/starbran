Full Stack Wireless Communication Systems and Radio Frequency Engineering specialist oriented towards Software Defined Radio platforms for rudimentary and niche Concept of Operations. Graduated with an Honors Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Minor degrees in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from Idaho State University. Ronald E. McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement Program alumni and University Honors Program alumni continuing education in Signal Processing and Communications through the Master of Science in Engineering in Electrical Engineering from Arizona State University. Successfully passed the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying Fundamentals of Engineering Examination, earning the title of Engineer in Training to start the process of obtaining the Principles and Practice of Engineering Licensure in Electronics, Controls, and Communications.

Contributed to and lead teams in the development, testing, and demonstration of projects involving RADAR Systems, Cognitive Radio, Spectrum Sharing, Machine Learning, High Frequency Communication Systems, Real-Time Operating Systems, Software Implemented Waveforms, Bandwidth and Power Constrained Communication Systems, Mesh Network Communication Systems, and Low Probability of Intercept/Detect Communication Systems. Expertise primarily resides in Layers 1, 2, and 5 of the Internet Protocol Stack, but is experienced in development on all five layers.

Developmental interests are in the domain of Signal Processing and Radio Frequency Circuitry for aerospace platforms including datalinks for guided defense systems, exploratory spacecraft, satellite communication systems, combat aircraft systems, and specialized tactical communication systems. Excited about fast/deterministic, memory-safe, and straightforward system and algorithm development using Rust and Python for applications that have meaningful impact to the world, national security, and public safety. Values four key principles in industry: integrity, discipline, respect, and inclusivity. Passionate about athletics, especially combat sports. Born and raised Idahoan planning to explore all of the state’s best features.
